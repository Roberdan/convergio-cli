# Convergio V7 — Markets & Go-To-Market (Education + Schools + Business)

**Status:** Draft for approval  
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Purpose:** Define the three target markets, their offers, and execution tactics (short/medium/long term).

---

## 1) Market A — Education Consumer (Parents + Students)

### Product promise
- Fast, accessible learning support with strong privacy controls.
- Local-first option (MLX/Ollama) for privacy and cost.

### Differentiators
- Accessibility-first UX.
- Curriculum-aligned agent packs.
- Offline/local mode that actually works.

### Pricing
- BYOK default + optional managed add-on.

### GTM tactics
- Short term (0–3 mo):
  - ship a single flagship “Education Pack” with 3–5 top teachers
  - creator partnerships (teachers), GitHub + community
- Medium (3–9 mo):
  - referral loop + family plans
  - content marketing + open curriculum templates
- Long (9–24 mo):
  - marketplace (only after proven demand)

---

## 2) Market B — Schools (Public/Private)

### Product promise
- Admin-controlled AI learning assistant that is compliant and auditable.

### Non-negotiable requirements
- Data retention policies
- Admin dashboard + audit logs
- BYOK via school’s Azure tenant (preferred)
- Export and deletion flows

### Pricing options (choose one)
- Per-seat (teacher/admin) + student access included
- Per-student per-year (low ARPU, high volume)
- Pilot packages (fixed fee) to get procurement started

### GTM tactics
- Short term:
  - 5–10 pilot schools with strict scope
  - publish compliance posture and retention defaults
- Medium:
  - case studies + procurement playbook
  - integrations (SSO, roster)
- Long:
  - regional distribution partners

---

## 3) Market C — Business Teams (SMB)

### Product promise
- Orchestration + integrations + auditability, not “just chat”.

### Differentiators
- Multi-provider neutrality
- BYOK-first reduces security/compliance friction
- Tool/workflow orchestration with strong guardrails

### Pricing
- Org subscription (BYOK default) + add-ons

### GTM tactics
- Short term:
  - focus on 1–2 workflows (e.g., docs + tickets + code review)
  - templates and quickstart
- Medium:
  - integrations (Jira, GitHub, Slack)
- Long:
  - enterprise readiness (SLA, SSO, RBAC)

---

## 4) KPI Set (Per Market)

- Education consumer: activation, retention, paid conversion, support load
- Schools: pilot-to-contract conversion, procurement cycle time, renewal
- Business: org activation, expansion, churn

---

## 5) Brutal Scope Control

If you try to maximize all three markets at once, you will lose.

**Recommendation:**
- Phase 1: Education consumer + a small number of school pilots
- Phase 2: Business templates once the platform contracts are stable
