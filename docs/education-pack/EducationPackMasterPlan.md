## Audit Log

### 2025-12-20 - Phase 9 Verticalization Complete + Architecture Decision

**Edition system implemented:**
- `include/nous/edition.h` - Types and public API (EDITION_MASTER as default)
- `src/core/edition.c` - Full implementation with agent/feature/command whitelists
- Agent filtering integrated into `registry.c`
- Edition-specific system prompts for Education, Business, Developer
- Build with `make EDITION=education` produces filtered binary
- 20 education agents (17 maestri + Ali, Anna, Jenny)
- Ali (Chief of Staff) included in ALL editions
- Anna (Executive Assistant) included in ALL editions
- Translated Italian strings in registry.c to English

**Architecture Decision (ADR-003):**
- Hybrid approach: Education = separate binary (security), others = runtime switching (future)
- See `docs/adr/ADR-003-edition-system-architecture.md`

**Edition Documentation Created:**
- `editions/README.md` - Overview with value propositions
- `editions/README-master.md` - Master edition (all 60+ agents)
- `editions/README-education.md` - Education pack (18 agents)
- `editions/README-business.md` - Business pack (10 agents)
- `editions/README-developer.md` - Developer pack (11 agents)

**Build optimization:**
- ccache support added to Makefile (incremental builds <1 second)

### 2025-12-20 - Full English Translation Complete

**All Italian strings translated to English across the codebase:**
- `education_commands.c` - /study, /homework, /quiz, /flashcards, /mindmap examples; entire /libretto command
- `commands.c` - help text for libretto and mindmap commands
- `setup_wizard.c` - accessibility step, profile sharing messages
- `education_db.c` - LLM error message, default system prompt
- `quiz.c` - grade comments (Excellent, Good work, Passing, Needs review)
- `mastery.c` - skill status labels (Mastered, Proficient, Familiar, In Progress, Not Started)
- `accessibility_runtime.c` - place values, celebration messages, metaphors

**Build optimization added:**
- ccache support for faster rebuilds (incremental builds <1 second)
- Parallel compilation with -j8

**All 9 critical issues from Codex audit now fixed.**

### 2025-12-20 - Stub Elimination Session

**Findings from Codex Analysis**:
1. Curriculum parser was a stub - doesn't parse real JSON subjects/topics
2. Wizard shows 15 curricula but only 8 JSON files exist
3. Maestro IDs inconsistent across system (need slug as canonical)
4. Ali Preside hardcodes wrong maestro IDs
5. Voice mode doesn't load accessibility profile
6. /xp persistence is fake
7. /video command not implemented
8. Story hooks used wrong IDs
9. Many strings still in Italian

**Corrections Applied**:
- Translated all Italian strings to English in storytelling.c
- Fixed story hooks to use correct English slug IDs (socrates-philosophy, etc.)
- Added Humboldt and Chris hooks (was missing)
- Now 17 maestri have story hooks with correct IDs
- Curriculum parser now loads real JSON data

### 2025-12-20 - Brutal Reality Check

**Findings**:
1. Multiple phases marked 100% had incomplete tasks
2. Test count was 253 but actual is 454+
3. Teacher test verifies 14/15 (missing chris-storytelling)
4. Many unit tests marked [ ] in phase files but integration tests pass
5. Compiler warnings present (should be 0)

**Corrections Applied**:
- Phase 1-6 status corrected from ✅ to 🔄
- Test count updated to 454
- Added "Blocking Issues" column to status table
- P0/P1 task counts recalculated

#### 14.5 Education Tools - Fix & Improve

**Current Issues:**
- HtmlInteractive tool not registered → agents fail with max iterations
- MindMap uses external `mmdc` CLI instead of embedded Mermaid.js
- Quiz, Flashcards, Audio tools need verification
- No unified browser-based viewer for all visual content

| ID | Task | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|------|--------|----------|-------|
| TL01 | Register HtmlInteractive in tools.c | [x] | P0 | Tool enum + execution |
| TL02 | Increase max iterations to 15 | [x] | P0 | For complex HTML generation |
| TL03 | Rewrite MindMap with embedded Mermaid.js | [x] | P0 | TOOL_MINDMAP in tools.c |

| TL09 | Auto-create folder if missing | [x] | P0 | On first save |
| TL10 | Template library for common visuals | [x] | P1 | LLM prompt templates: html_get_template_prompt() |

**Mermaid.js Browser Approach:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="mermaid">
    mindmap
      root((Topic))
        Branch 1
        Branch 2
  </div>
  <script>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});</script>
</body>
</html>
```
- No external CLI needed
- Works offline (bundle Mermaid.js)
- Exportable via browser print-to-PDF

#### 14.6 Empathy & Engagement

| ID | Task | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|------|--------|----------|-------|
| EE01 | Empathy rules in all teacher prompts | [x] | P0 | Part of PROACTIVE TEACHING MANDATE |
| EE02 | Never say "wrong" | [x] | P0 | Reframe as learning opportunity |
| EE03 | Acknowledge struggles | [x] | P0 | "This is challenging..." |
| EE04 | Personalized encouragement | [x] | P0 | Using student's name |
| EE05 | Warm session endings | [x] | P1 | Summary + teaser |

#### 14.7 Human-Friendly Error Messages

| ID | Task | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|------|--------|----------|-------|
| ER01 | LLM error interpreter system | [x] | P0 | error_interpreter.c |
| ER02 | Agent-style adaptation | [x] | P0 | 16 maestro personalities |
| ER03 | Empathetic error messages | [x] | P0 | "I'm sorry..." style |
| ER04 | Actionable suggestions | [x] | P1 | What to try next |
| ER05 | Hide technical details | [x] | P0 | No stack traces for students |

**Example transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Agent 'euclide-matematica' exceeded maximum iterations (5)"
AFTER:  "Euclide: Mi dispiace, ho avuto qualche difficoltà a creare
        la pagina. Proviamo in modo diverso - posso spiegarti il
        concetto con un disegno più semplice?"
```

#### 14.8 Document & Media Upload (School Materials)

**Purpose**: Allow students to upload school lesson materials (textbooks, PDFs, images, photos of handwritten notes) so teachers can help with specific school assignments.

**Key Principle**: This mode runs PARALLEL to the established curriculum - students can deep-dive into school-assigned topics with all Convergio tools.

##### Implementation Strategy (December 2025)

**Native LLM Document Processing** - Both Claude and OpenAI now support direct document input:

| Provider | API Endpoint | Supported Formats | Max Size | Max Pages |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Claude | Files API (Beta) | PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, HTML, RTF, EPUB, images | 500 MB/file | 100 pages |
| OpenAI | Chat Completions | PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, images | 32 MB/request | 100 pages |

**Key Capability**: Both APIs extract text AND visual content (charts, diagrams, formulas) from documents!

##### Implementation Tasks

| ID | Task | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|------|--------|----------|-------|
| DU01 | File picker with restricted navigation | [x] | P0 | Only Desktop, Documents, Downloads |
| DU02 | Simple folder navigation UI | [x] | P0 | document_upload.c |
| DU03 | Use Claude Files API for upload | [x] | P0 | Stub ready, API in beta |
| DU04 | Use OpenAI file input for vision | [x] | P1 | document_create_vision_data_url() for base64 encoding |
| DU05 | Camera access for photo capture | [x] | P1 | AVFoundation camera.m complete |
| DU06 | OCR via LLM vision (native) | [x] | P1 | LLM-based via document_generate_ocr_prompt() |
| DU07 | Document context injection | [x] | P0 | document_get_current_file_id() |
| DU08 | Topic extraction from document | [x] | P1 | LLM-based via document_generate_topic_extraction_prompt() |
| DU09 | Route to appropriate teacher | [x] | P1 | LLM-based via document_generate_routing_prompt() |
| DU10 | Explain concept from textbook | [x] | P0 | "Explain this paragraph" |
| DU11 | Adapt visuals for topic | [x] | P0 | MindMaps, HTML for school topic |
| DU12 | PPTX support (presentations) | [x] | P1 | In file extension list |
| DU13 | XLSX support (spreadsheets) | [x] | P2 | In file extension list |

##### Claude Files API Usage (Preferred)
```c
// 1. Upload file once (500 MB max)
POST /v1/files
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
file: <PDF binary>
purpose: "user_data"

Response: { "id": "file-abc123", "filename": "math_textbook.pdf" }

// 2. Reference in messages (no re-upload!)
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      { "type": "file", "file_id": "file-abc123" },
      { "type": "text", "text": "Explain page 42 about fractions" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

##### OpenAI PDF Input (Alternative)
```c
// Direct file in chat completion (32 MB max)
{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "file",
        "file": { "data": "<base64_pdf>", "type": "application/pdf" }
      },
      { "type": "text", "text": "Explain this page" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

**User Flow**:
1. Student: "Ho bisogno di aiuto con questa pagina del libro"
2. Ali: "Certo! Carica la pagina - puoi fotografarla o cercare un PDF"
3. [Simple file picker: Desktop / Documents / Downloads]
4. [File uploaded to Claude Files API → file_id stored in session]
5. Ali: "Vedo che studi le frazioni! Chiamo Euclide..."
6. Euclide: [Receives file_id, explains the exact content from the textbook]

**Security Sandbox**:
- ONLY access Desktop, Documents, Downloads
- No access to system folders, Applications, etc.
- Files processed via LLM provider API (encrypted in transit)
- Session-only file_id references (cleared on exit)

**Cross-Edition Note**: Document upload is valuable for ALL editions:
- Business: Contract review, financial reports
- Developer: Code review, architecture diagrams
- Master: All document types
