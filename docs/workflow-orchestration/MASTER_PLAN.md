## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### ⚠️ PRE-IMPLEMENTATION SETUP

**CRITICAL**: Complete setup checklist before starting development.

**📋 See [SETUP_CHECKLIST.md](SETUP_CHECKLIST.md) for complete setup instructions.**

**Quick Setup:**

#### Core Convergio (Main Repo)

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
cd /Users/roberdan/GitHub/ConvergioCLI
git checkout -b feature/workflow-orchestration origin/main
git push -u origin feature/workflow-orchestration

# 2. Create worktree
git worktree add ../ConvergioCLI-workflow feature/workflow-orchestration
cd ../ConvergioCLI-workflow

# 3. Verify
git status  # Should be on feature/workflow-orchestration
make clean && make  # Should build
```

**Worktree Location**: `/Users/roberdan/GitHub/ConvergioCLI-workflow`

#### Convergio Zed (Integration Repo)

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
cd /Users/roberdan/GitHub/convergio-zed
git checkout -b feature/zed-workflow-orchestration origin/main
git push -u origin feature/zed-workflow-orchestration

# 2. Create worktree
git worktree add ../convergio-zed-workflow feature/zed-workflow-orchestration
cd ../convergio-zed-workflow

# 3. Verify
git status  # Should be on feature/zed-workflow-orchestration
# Build according to Zed instructions
```

**Worktree Location**: `/Users/roberdan/GitHub/convergio-zed-workflow`

**📖 See [SETUP_CHECKLIST.md](SETUP_CHECKLIST.md) for complete verification steps.**

### Development Process

1. **Start Phase**
   ```bash
   # Ensure worktree is clean
   git status
   
   # Create phase branch
   git checkout -b phase-1-foundation
   ```

2. **Implement Phase**
   - Follow phase-specific implementation plan
   - **Write tests FIRST** (TDD approach - test before code)
   - Run tests frequently: `make test_workflow`
   - Check sanitizers: `make DEBUG=1 SANITIZE=address,undefined,thread test_workflow`
   - **Commit after every test pass** (never lose more than 1 hour of work)
   - **Tag checkpoints** after each task completion
   - See [CRASH_RECOVERY.md](CRASH_RECOVERY.md) for recovery procedures

3. **Pre-Commit Checks**
   ```bash
   # Quality gate (runs all checks)
   make quality_gate_workflow
   
   # If quality gate fails, fix issues before committing
   # Pre-commit hook will also run automatically
   
   # Quality gate checks:
   # - Build (zero warnings)
   # - All tests (unit, integration, fuzz, sanitizer)
   # - Coverage (>= 80%)
   # - Static analysis (zero issues)
   # - Security audit (zero vulnerabilities)
   # - Memory leaks (zero leaks)
   # - Data races (zero races)
   
   # See [ZERO_TOLERANCE_POLICY.md](ZERO_TOLERANCE_POLICY.md) for details
   ```

4. **Commit with Conventional Commits**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(workflow): implement workflow engine core"
   git commit -m "test(workflow): add unit tests for workflow engine"
   git commit -m "fix(workflow): fix memory leak in workflow_destroy"
   ```

5. **Verify with App Release Manager**
   ```bash
   # Run app-release-manager agent
   convergio
   > @app-release-manager prepare release v5.4.0
   
   # Or manually verify:
   > @app-release-manager check quality gates
   ```

6. **Create PR for Phase**
   ```bash
   # Push phase branch
   git push origin phase-1-foundation
   
   # Create PR via GitHub CLI
   gh pr create \
     --title "feat(workflow): Phase 1 - Foundation" \
     --body "Implements workflow engine core and checkpointing.
     
     - [x] Workflow engine implemented
     - [x] Checkpoint manager implemented
     - [x] Unit tests passing
     - [x] Security checklist complete
     
     Closes #XXX"
   
   # Or create via GitHub web UI
   ```

7. **PR Review Process**
   - Wait for automated checks (CI)
   - Address review comments
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Get approval from maintainer

8. **Merge PR**
   ```bash
   # Merge via GitHub CLI (NEVER squash - preserve history)
   gh pr merge phase-1-foundation --merge
   
   # Or merge via GitHub web UI
   ```

9. **Update Master Plan**
   - Mark phase as completed in this file
   - Update phase status
   - Document any deviations or learnings

2. **Complete [SETUP_CHECKLIST.md](SETUP_CHECKLIST.md)** - Setup both Core and Zed worktrees
3. **Read mandatory documents** (see DOCUMENTS section above)
4. **Read [INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)** for integration details
5. **Start Phase 1** implementation (includes CLI commands and docs)
6. **Set up CI/CD** for automated testing (if needed)

## SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGY (Core ↔ Zed)

### Development Flow

**Phase 1-4: Develop in Core First**
- All development happens in `/Users/roberdan/GitHub/ConvergioCLI-workflow`
- Core Convergio is the source of truth
- After each phase completion, sync to Zed

**Phase 5: Integration in Both**
- Integrate in Core first
- Then port integration to Zed (adapting to Zed's architecture)

### Sync Process (After Each Phase)

```bash
# After Phase X completion in Core
cd /Users/roberdan/GitHub/ConvergioCLI-workflow
git checkout feature/workflow-orchestration
git merge phase-X-complete
git push origin feature/workflow-orchestration

# Sync to Zed (manual port or script)
cd /Users/roberdan/GitHub/convergio-zed-workflow
# Port changes from Core to Zed
# Adapt to Zed's architecture (Rust/GPUI instead of C)
# Commit and push
```

**Note**: Zed integration may require architectural adaptations (Rust instead of C, GPUI instead of CLI). See [COMPATIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md](COMPATIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md) for details.

## PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY

**Reference**: [PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT.md](PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT.md)

### Core Convergio Parallelization

**Phase 1**: Sequential (due to dependencies)
- F1 → F2 → F3 → F4

**Phases 2-4**: Fully parallel (after Phase 1)
- Create 3 separate worktrees:
  ```bash
  git worktree add ../ConvergioCLI-phase2 phase-2-task-decomposition
  git worktree add ../ConvergioCLI-phase3 phase-3-group-chat
  git worktree add ../ConvergioCLI-phase4 phase-4-conditional-routing
  ```
- Develop all 3 phases simultaneously
- Merge all 3 before Phase 5

**Phase 5**: Sequential (depends on Phases 1-4)

### Multi-Agent/Process Execution

**If using multiple agents or processes:**

1. **Each agent/process gets its own worktree:**
   ```bash
   # Agent 1: Phase 2
   git worktree add ../ConvergioCLI-agent1 phase-2-task-decomposition
   
   # Agent 2: Phase 3
   git worktree add ../ConvergioCLI-agent2 phase-3-group-chat
   
   # Agent 3: Phase 4
   git worktree add ../ConvergioCLI-agent3 phase-4-conditional-routing
   ```

2. **Each agent follows same quality gates:**
   - All tests must pass
   - Zero warnings
   - Coverage >= 80%
   - See [ZERO_TOLERANCE_POLICY.md](ZERO_TOLERANCE_POLICY.md)

3. **Coordination:**
   - Daily sync: `git pull origin feature/workflow-orchestration`
   - After completion: Create PR from worktree branch
   - Merge coordinator: Merge all PRs before Phase 5

### Zed Integration Strategy

**Zed development follows Core:**
- Core Convergio is developed first (source of truth)
- After each phase, port to Zed (with architectural adaptations)
- Zed uses same phase structure and quality gates
- See [SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGY](#synchronization-strategy-core--zed) above

**Time Savings:**
- Sequential: 44 days
- Parallel (Phases 2-4): 30 days
- **Savings: 14 days (32% faster)**
