## Why Convergio Business?

### Unified Business Intelligence
Instead of switching between disconnected tools, Convergio Business agents share context. Fabio (Sales) knows what Andrea (Customer Success) is working on. Sofia (Marketing) understands which deals are in the pipeline. Amy (CFO) sees the full financial picture.

### Strategic Decision Support
Get McKinsey-level strategic analysis without the consulting fees. Domik applies structured frameworks (MECE, hypothesis-driven analysis) to your business challenges and presents options with clear trade-offs.

### Customer Lifecycle Mastery
From lead generation (Sofia) to deal closing (Fabio) to retention (Andrea), your customer journey is fully supported by specialized agents who understand handoffs and continuity.

### Always Available
Your AI business team works 24/7, never takes vacation, and maintains perfect context across all interactions. Ask them at 2 AM for a sales forecast and get an instant, accurate response.
